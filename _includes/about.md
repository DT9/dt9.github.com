My name is Dennis Truong. My day to day life keeps me fairly busy, interning at my company and constantly learning new tech stacks. My days consist of being a software developer, student, and mentor. I love what I do and who I do it with. I'm privileged to work and learn from and along with some of the smartest people in my field (ie. [Tian](http://tianzhiwang.me/) and [Dan](http://shouyang.space/)). My blog exists to share that knowledge.

It's not wrong to promote learning and spread knowledge - it's very fundamental to everything we do and a calling to many who work there, including me. I believe that sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we made along the way improves the experience and saves time for the next 100 or 100,000 people doing similar. For the same reasons, I believe strongly in open source.

In the mean time, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dt9), and occasionally [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/13249/denweny).
